			Total  401 hours

	Last sprint we had 350 hours and we did 35 SPs.
	This sprint we have 401 hours. So we think we can do 40SPs.

Sprint 1 - 210 Sps	Sprint 2 - 170 Sps	 	Sprint 3 - 240 Sps
		Current velocity= (210 + 170 + 240) / 3 = 207Sps.
Answer 1) Till May 15 we can do 4 sprints i.e. 4 sprints * 207 Sps = 828 Sps.
	  We can finish 25 User stories.
Answer 2) for 15 user stories we need to do 510Sps.
		We need 3 sprints
		Time = 3 sprints * 4 weeks + 2 weeks = 14 weeks
	1-Apr.
Answer 3) To do 1080 SPs, we need 6 sprints.
	Time = 6 sprints * 4 weeks + 2 weeks = 26 weeks.
No.

Cycle Time - Time when the customer asks for feature to that feature in deployment
		Option 2 > Option 1 > Option 3

Evaluation
	PO - Profitability
	SM - Productivity and Cycle time
	Team - PO as a unit.

Ken S - ScrumMaster.
	Team is now skipping documentation, writing tests and code quality is poor.
	PO wants us to finish earlier.
	We have to finish by 1-Jan - $2Million
	Cost to fix to problems is $0.2Million.

XP - Kent Beck
	Minimum wage
	Software in production - Huge bonus
	Scrum doesn't have technical practices.
